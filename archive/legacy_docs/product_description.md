# DoseTap Product Description

## Overview
DoseTap is a specialized, medical-grade iOS and watchOS application designed exclusively for patients prescribed **XYWAV** (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates) for the treatment of narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia. 

Unlike generic medication trackers, DoseTap focuses entirely on the critical **night-time dosing regimen** required by XYWAV, which mandates a strictly timed second dose 2.5 to 4 hours after the first.

## Core Value Proposition
*   **Safety First**: Enforces the 150–240 minute safety window between doses to prevent under-dosing or dangerous over-dosing.
*   **Night-First Experience**: The UI is designed for dark environments, utilizing high-contrast, red-tinted visuals to preserve night vision and minimize sleep disruption.
*   **Cognitive Load Reduction**: Recognizes that users may be groggy or disoriented. Operations are simplified to single taps or long-presses, with clear, large typography.

## Key Features
*   **Dose Window Timer**: A visual countdown ring indicating exactly when the second dose is safe to take, when the optimal target is approaching, and when the window is closing.
*   **Smart Snooze**: Allows snoozing the second dose alert in 10-minute increments, but intelligently disables snoozing when the safety window is within 15 minutes of closing.
*   **Offline Resilience**: Fully functional without an internet connection. Actions are queued and synced when connectivity is restored.
*   **Biometric & Hardware Integration**: Supports Apple Watch for wrist-based checking and Flic buttons for tactile, screen-free logging.
*   **Clinical Analytics**: Tracks compliance, naturally-waked events, and window accuracy for export to sleep specialists.

## Target Audience
*   **Primary**: Patients prescribed XYWAV who struggle with the strict middle-of-the-night timing requirements.
*   **Secondary**: Sleep specialists and caregivers monitoring adherence.

## Platform Support
*   **iOS**: Primary interface for setup, history, and detailed visualization.
*   **watchOS**: Companion app for immediate night-time actions (Take, Snooze, Skip).
