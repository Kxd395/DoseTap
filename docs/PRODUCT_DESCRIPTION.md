# DoseTap - Product Description

> **Precision Medication Timing for XYWAV Patients**

---

## What is DoseTap?

DoseTap is a specialized iOS and watchOS application designed exclusively for patients taking XYWAV (sodium oxybate) medication. Unlike generic medication reminders, DoseTap understands the unique two-dose nightly protocol that XYWAV requires and ensures you never miss your critical timing window.

---

## The Problem We Solve

XYWAV is a powerful medication for narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia that requires precise timing:

1. **Dose 1** is taken at bedtime
2. **Dose 2** must be taken 2.5 to 4 hours later (150-240 minutes)
3. Missing the window means skipping Dose 2 entirely
4. You're likely drowsy or asleep when Dose 2 is due

**The challenge:** How do you reliably wake up, take medication, and track it accurately while half-asleep in a dark room?

**Our solution:** DoseTap.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Take Dose 1
Tap one button when you take your first dose. DoseTap starts tracking.

### Step 2: Sleep Peacefully
DoseTap calculates your personal dose window and sets up intelligent alerts.

### Step 3: Wake & Take Dose 2
When your window opens, DoseTap wakes you with escalating notifications. One tap logs Dose 2.

### Step 4: Sleep Again
DoseTap marks your night complete. Review your history anytime.
